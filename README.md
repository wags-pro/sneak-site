# sneak-site
a primitive iFrame that looks like an ad displayed in a math themed website.

This was an expiriment, and apparently, it works on most teachers. You type the FULL url into the search bar with a plceholder saying: "search for quizzes here".(this includes https or http so it would look something like https://url-goes-here.com). Your url will be displayed in a corner window, next to a KFC ad.
